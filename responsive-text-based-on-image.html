<div class="box">
   <img>
   <h1>Lorem ipsum dolor ..</h1>
</div>

.box {
  display: inline-block;
}
h1 {
  width: 0;
  min-width: 100%;
}


This trick rely on two things:
  - We make the container (the box element) a shrink-to-fit element (its width is defined by its content). 
    I used inline-block but it can be a float element, a table one, a flex item, etc.
    
  - We make our title having a width equal to 0 so it will not contribute to the container width. 
    Our container will have its width defined only by the image. 
    We add min-width: 100% to resize our title and make its width equal to the container width (the one defined previously with the image!). 
    Yes it's a bit crazy or let's say magic ðŸ˜‰
